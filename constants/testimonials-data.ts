      "One of the best photographers I have ever had a photo shoot with. His natural photos are just perfect, no need to edit them. Our first part of photoshoot is done and we are so satisfied with it. Can't wait for second part which will be after our baby is born. Rod is busy but worth waiting, and the price is also reasonable. Such an amazing photographer ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",

Very kind and patient to get the right angle and right shot. Quick in delivering the photos as well. When we saw the photos, all of them were beautiful. He is a magician with his camera.
